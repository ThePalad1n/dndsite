        <p class="card-text">Horned quickling devil - Small fiend (devil), neutral evil
          a horned devil with the speed of a quickling found in the forest and challenged him to a race. after being
          defeated we formed a bond solely for sparring. N'oth finds me very intriguing as no mortal has ever been
          interested in fighting him. Evenly matched but N'oth usually comes out on top. He may not admit it but he
          likes the perseverance and watching Mooshro grow. He travels
          with me doing his own thing with two mutual agreements. Never attacks my party members and never interferes
          with my fight no matter the outcome. Wears a magic ring and
          goes back home here and there but is always able to locate mooshro through a red earing he wears.</p>
