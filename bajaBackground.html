        <p>This is for a fun twist on the traditional wizard play style/casting. You are a wizard that was trying to go
          to the wizarding academy. But to your suprise, even with great magical ability, you are unable to cast spells
          correctly so you drop out. You meet a tinkerer at an inn where he tell you he might be able to help. The neext
          day he takes you back to his workshop where he presents to you...</p>

        <p>Varriation One: Spell Cannon</p>
        <br>
        <p>The spell cannon is a cannon that has dials for each spell slot and 1 normal cannon option. When switching to
          a spell level, the player can put the required components in the cannon as ammo and cast the spell. You must
          know the spell bbeing casted and must have a spell slot to cast it. Damage and range are also the same. The
          normal cannon is a 1d12 bldg at 30ft range. The catch of this class is that without the cannon the wizard
          cannot cast their spells, even with knowlegde of it.</p>

        <p>Variaton Two: 10 Rings</p>
        <br>
        <p>each ring represents a level of spell from cantrip to level 9 and each hold a charge equal to their
          corresponding spell slots of that character. The chargges, like normal, recharge after a long rest. However,
          an unarmed attack deals 1d6 + str.</p>
